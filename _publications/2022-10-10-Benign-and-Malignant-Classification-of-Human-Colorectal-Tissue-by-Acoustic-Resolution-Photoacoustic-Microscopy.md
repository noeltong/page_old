Thanks to the First Medical Centre, Chinese PLA General Hospital. Classifying the benign and malignant tissues using wavelet transform of the photoacoustic microscopy signals.
  * Signals of cancer, polyp and normal tissues were obtained by scanning the \textit{ex-vivo} colorectal samples;
  * Classify the cancer and normal regions with wavelet transform.
