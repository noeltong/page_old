This work completed with Department of Critical Care Medicine, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University. The aim of this study was to assess the mortality risk of critically ill patients at risk of hypoperfusion in a prospective cohort by infrared thermography combined with deep learning methods.
  * Compared the classification capability of several widely used vision backbones;
  * Combined conventional cross-entropy loss with focal loss and label smoothing, which further improved the performance on the imbalanced dataset.
