Comparison of the classification capability of several machine learning algorithms using the photoacoustic microscopy signals of benign and malignant colorectal tissues. This work is a further study of our companion work published in *2022 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium*.
  * The signal dataset was further improved, involving more tissue samples and accuracy;
  * Classification of the cancer and normal signals using several machine learning algorithms, with several metrics calculated and compared.
